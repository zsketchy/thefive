# Human OS Lite

## Why?

I created this for myself, but it is open for others.

The religions and philosophies of the world have a lot to offer. Most of them share common values and ideas.

But in 2025, I/we need common ground, through simiplicity and clarity. So I created this minimalist, lightweight human operating system that attempts to capture the overlapping parts of all major religions and philosophies.

It is an ever-evolving but clearly versioned essence of "principles" for how to live a good life as a human being, and "practices" that are weekly cornerstones for living a good human life.

It aims to be *as consistent as possible* with all religious and philosophical belief systems, targeting a robust and universal system of principles and practices when intertwined as a set.

It makes no comment on spirituality, but is fully open to being interpreted as so due to its targeted universality.

Click the `principles.txt` to view the principles, or `practices.txt` to view the practices.

If you'd like to see the justification for each rule and it's alignment with major religions and philosophies, click the `justifications.txt`.
