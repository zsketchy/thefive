# The Five

## Why?

This repository contains an ever-evolving but clearly versioned essence of "rules" for how to live a good life as a human being.

It aims to be as consistent as possible with all religious and philosophical belief systems, targeting a robust and universal system of rules when intertwined as a set.

It makes no comment on spirituality, but is fully open to being interpreted as so due to its targeted universality.

#3 How to contribute

This repo is open to have changes proposed. You must follow the linting rules. When proposing a change it must be evidenced or clear that it is a universal, non-partisan change that makes the system more robust. It must not favour one religion over another.

## Text Linting (i.e. document rules)

To ensure concise, deliberate and clear thought with any wishful change or addition, the rules file has a linter rules for:
- Maximum of 5 lines (rules)
- Maximum of 10 words per line 

## How to lint

```bash
python3 text_linter.py rules.txt
```
