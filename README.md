## Purpose

This repository contains an ever-evolving but clearly versioned essence of rules for how to live a good life. It is as consistent as possible with all religious and philosophical belief systems, targeting a very robust and universal system of rules as a set.

## Text Linting (i.e. document rules)

To ensure concise, deliberate and clear thought with any wishful change or addition, the rules file has a linter rules for:
- Maximum of 5 lines (rules)
- Maximum of 10 words per line 

## Usage

```bash
python3 text_linter.py rules.txt
```
